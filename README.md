Scripts to run processing and 1st-level functional connectivity analyses in CONN/Matlab

"dg_fcmri_rs_wholeGroup.m" runs default MNI processing available in CONN, and 1st-level ROI-to-ROI and Seed-to-Voxel analyses on RESTING-STATE DATASETS. At the end, it allows to open CONN's GUI to visualize results. The script runs these processes with a WHOLE group of patients and controls. Therefore, this script allows us to do a Quality Check on the dataset and explore the connectivity patterns in the sample measured.

Soon, I will upload scripts with contrasts, that is, to compare patients to controls in resting-state and task-based fMRI measurements.
